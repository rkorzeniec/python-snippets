# This question is asked by Amazon.
# Given two arrays of numbers, where the first array is a subset of the second array,
# return an array containing all the next greater elements for each element in the first array, in the second array.
# If there is no greater element for any element, output -1 for that number.

# Ex: Given the following arraysâ€¦
# nums1 = [4, 1, 2], nums2 = [1, 3, 4, 2], return [-1, 3, -1] because no element in nums2 is greater than 4, 3 is the first number in nums2 greater than 1, and no element in nums2 is greater than 2.
# nums1 = [2, 4], nums2 = [1, 2, 3, 4], return [3, -1] because 3 is the first greater element that occurs in nums2 after 2 and no element is greater than 4.
